<h1>My Favourite movies According to me (Nivetha)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>This is my favourite of all time. It connects to me emotionally.</p>

<h3>Ferdinand</h3>
<p>I cannot describe how this movie means to be. But for this one I can tell you one thing, its okay to be different.</p>

<h3>Marmaduke</h3>
<p>This is my latest liking movie and its really a good one to watch. Its about what if the pets could talk to eachother and hows the life around it with pets and humans.</p>
